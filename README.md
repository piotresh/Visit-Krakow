Creating a Classy and Timeless Website for Krakow

For my website showcasing Krakow, I wanted to capture the city's timeless elegance. I decided to let the front page speak for itself with a collection of stunning, large-scale images of Krakow. As you scroll down, the rich colors of these captivating visuals are maintained at the top of the viewport, creating a visually cohesive effect. To further enhance the user experience, the navigation bar subtly shrinks upon scrolling, providing a smooth transition.

Initially, the images loaded sequentially, creating a slight delay. To address this, I implemented a fade-in animation triggered after the page fully loads. This ensures a seamless and polished user experience. While I encountered some challenges in centering the navigation bar and integrating Bootstrap for a visually appealing design, in retrospect, I might have spent more time on the overall website structure and planning. Im not sure how it has happened but last minute the carousel has stopped working. You can still see the images when you click the buttons. Please try so.
